# @QbitArtifacts/QBitKit

This library holds a set of standard classes.

## Getting Started

### Install

First, you will need to authenticate against Github npm packages to be able to install package, see [this][gh-npm-install]

You can either add a dependency to your package.json, change to the latest version.

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        ...
        "@qbitartifacts/qbitkit-ng": "^0.0.8"
    }
}
```

Or install from cmd:

```
$ npm install @qbitartifacts/qbitkit-ng@latest
```

### Usage

#### QEventsService

This service is used as a pub-sub internally, with some extra functionality.

**Usage:**

```ts
import { QEventsService } from '@qbitkit-ng/public-api';

class MyComponent {
  constructor(public events$: EventsService) {
    this.events.on('event-name').subscribe(action);

    // You can find a specific event as well
    this.events.find('event-name').subscribe(action);

    // Fire event
    this.events.fire('event-name', { data: 'goes here' });

    // Remove listener
    this.events.off('event-name');
  }
}
```
